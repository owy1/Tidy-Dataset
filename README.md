The purpose of Getting and Cleaning Data week 4 project is to write a script called
“run_analysis.R” to organize the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone data collected from 
Samsung Galaxy S smartphone per tidy data principle.

The dataset is downloaded from URL:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The unzip file contains a Readme file that describes the dataset in details.

The dataset description is downloaded from URL:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The script accomplishes five goals:
	1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
	5.	A tidy data set is ordered by the average of each mean and standard deviation for each activity and each subject.

Finally, the tidy data set is written to "meanstd_avg.csv" and output to desktop.
